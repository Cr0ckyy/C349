# Combined-IOS-Projects
- The project is a compilation of IOS-Swift-Storyboard Projects.
- The projects were part of two modules, iPhone and iPad Programmings, studied as a diploma student at Republic Polytechnic.
- These individual projects were combined into a single project file.
- The project file was forked from a coursemate who studied the same diploma course and modules.
- This was done due to the inability to locate the original projects.
